# pubmed-proto development notes

pubmed-proto is the **generator** for the `pubmed_proto` package. See
[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) for the domain model and [`README.md`](README.md) for
usage and release steps.

## Working norms

Operating directives for Claude (and any agent) in this repo; they counteract
default model dispositions. These match the CPG standard (see `litfetch` /
`themis-internal`).

- **Resist the minimal-diff reflex.** Aim for the correct fix at the right
  complexity level — not the smallest change that hides a symptom, not
  gold-plated.
- **Fail loudly and early.** Raise on a missing input or precondition; never
  fall back to a default to limp along.
- **Push back; don't just comply.** When a design, name, or approach seems
  worse, say so with reasoning. The author owns the final call.
- **Investigate before producing.** Read the code and verify constraints first.
- **Ask when unsure** rather than assume intent.

## Repo-specific gotchas

- **The consumable artifact is generated, not committed.** `generated/` and
  `dist/` are gitignored. Never hand-edit generated output — change
  `pubmed_transforms.yaml` (or the DTD) and regenerate. To fix how the schema is
  shaped, the engine is `xsd-former`, not this repo.
- **Version lives in `pubmed_transforms.yaml` (`build.version`)**, not in this
  repo's `pyproject.toml`. That is the version `xsdformer` stamps into the wheel
  and what the release tag must match.
- **`xsd-former` is a build input.** A floor lives in `pyproject.toml`; the
  exact version is pinned in `uv.lock`. Bumping it can change generated output,
  so re-run the round-trip gate after any bump.
- **The round-trip test builds via the `xsdformer` CLI** (the shipping path) and
  imports the result in a subprocess — because the compiled `*_pb2` registers in
  a global descriptor pool. Keep that isolation.

## Before committing

- `uv run --group test pytest` — the round-trip gate must pass.
- `uv run --group lint ruff check . && uv run --group lint ruff format --check .`
- `uv lock` if dependencies changed, and commit `uv.lock`.
